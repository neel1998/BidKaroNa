# BidKaroNa

## Description

A full-fledged BlockChain based software web application providing an auctioning platform that ensures complete transparency and security regarding the highest bid and bidder eligibility. We have a blind-bidding design which offers several benefits over the traditional system. The blockchain-based system can ensure transparent and publicly verifiable auctions in IIIT for example in Bakul VolleyBall League.

## Components

### Create Asset
